# hs-final

In order to have a chance at 100% on the final in my C# class, we had to choose the hardest project type, which was to try and reverse-engineer a retro game using what we knew and any content files we could find/make ourselves. I chose Pacman. The project isn't complete, given the time restraint we had, but everything was functioning correctly save for the ghost AI. I left that for last because I had no idea how to approach that as a 1st year programming student, and I didn't wanna get hung up on research.

The teacher gave me a 96 anyway so pog
